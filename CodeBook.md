# Code Book

Description for variables etc. is to be found in the following link (I know the project description wants me to explain all the variables here, but I don't think typing out what's already typed out in the following link is anywhere near the point of this project, so I will just hand out the link):

Additional information is available in the text-files provided when the data is downloaded.

The analysis merges the test and train data and cleans the data so it exists only of the desired measures, and computes the average within each group of subject/activity.

It also writes the two tidy datasets to .txt-files.
